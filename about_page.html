    <h1 style="padding-left: 70px;">We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion</h1>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 70px;">Good things happen when people can move, whether across town or toward their dreams. 
    <br> Opportunities appear, open up, become reality. What started as a way to tap a button to get a ride 
    <br> has led to billions  of moments of human connection as people around the world go all
    <br> kinds of places in all kinds of ways with the help of our technology.</h3>

    <h1 style="padding-left: 700px; padding-top: 200px;">Sustainability</h1>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 700px;">Uber is committing to becoming a fully electric, zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking <br>
        place in zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with micromobility. It is our responsibility as the <br>
        argest mobility platform in the world to more aggressively tackle the challenge of climate change. We will <br>
        do this by offering riders more ways to ride green, helping drivers go electric, making transparency a <br>
        priority and partnering with NGOs and the private sector to help expedite a clean and just energy transition.</h3>
